# STOKEY.
Stokey is a web application (WebApp) project containing two main functions:
<br>
<br>
One is an interactive real time stock dashboard built using python library yfinance and pyplot. The Dashboard consist of a customable candlestick pattern plot (with Volume, 10MA, and 50MA indicator), stock summary, and stock info.  
<br>
The other one is a Japanese Chart Pattern Screener that can detect what stock fulfils a pattern's criteria. This aims to help investors understand stock chart and select potential stocks that match the investor's criteria. The screener is built with the help of python library TA-Lib
