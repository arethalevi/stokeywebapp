# STOKEY.
Stokey is a web application (WebApp) project containing two main functions:
- An interactive real-time Indonesian stock dashboard built using data from Yahoo finance API. The Dashboard consists of a customizable candlestick pattern plot (with Volume, 10MA, and 50MA indicators) made with PlotLy, stock summary, and stock info.
- Japanese Chart Pattern Screener that can detect what stock fulfills a pattern's criteria. This aims to help investors understand the stock chart and select potential stocks that match the investor's criteria. Users can input the pattern that they want to see, and the program will output a list of stocks that match the pattern.
